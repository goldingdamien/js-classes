Set of JavaScript classes for general use.
Shouldn't include anything too large(move to separate project).
Shouldn't include anything too specialized(partion elsewhere as unlikely to be used in most cases).
Should move into own project once gets of a substantial size.
May have varying formats, as is an ungrouped collection of classes.
